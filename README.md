# OpenDMA API for C#

At it's core, OpenDMA (Open Document Management Architecture) defines an
abstract model for Document Management and Enterprise Content Management
Systems.

The OpenDMA API provides an abstract interface to this model. It allows
to write content centric applications once, and run them against multiple
different Enterprise Content and Document Management Systems.

The API is available for different programming languages and enforces a
consistent style across these languages.

This repository contains the OpenDMA API for C# (and .net in general).

It has been auto-generated by the [OpenDMA API Builder](https://github.com/OpenDMA/opendma-api-builder).

## Installation

This project is not yet available via [NuGet](https://nuget.org/).

To install it locally, check out this git project and build it in Visual Studio.

## Usage

The OpenDMA API defines a set of interfaces that need to be implemented by an
OpenDMA Adaptor for an actual ECM system -- very similar to database drivers.

At this point, there are no known OpenDMA Adaptors for C#/.net yet.

There is a complete [OpenDMA Tutorial for Java](https://github.com/OpenDMA/opendma-java-tutorial)
showing the basic concepts which apply to C# as well.
